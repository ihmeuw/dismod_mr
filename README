Introduction
============

This project is the descriptive epidemiological meta-regression tool,
DisMod-MR, which grew out of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study
2010.  DisMod-MR has been developed for the Institute of Health
Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington from 2008-2013.


Installation
============

The file requirements.tex lists the Python packages necessary to run
DisMod-MR.  Unfortunately, PyCPPAD is not available with
pip/easy_install.

DisMod-MR has been installed successfully by at least one person outside of
my immediate peer group.  She says "I ended up using Anaconda and then
manually installing all the required packages individually. There were
also errors when I install a new package that required me to
re-install previous ones and restart the computer several times. Using
easyinstall was helpful. I also had to install GCC at some point. I
hope these would be helpful for making it easier for new users."

This installation section could be more detailed. Patches welcome.

Coding Practices
================

Write tests before code
Write equations before tests

Test quantitatively with simulation data
Test qualitatively with real data
Automate tests

Use a package instead of DIY
Test the package

Optimize code later
Optimize code for readability before speed

.py files should be short, less than 500 lines
Functions should be short, less than 25 lines
